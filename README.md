**Approved Proposal**
=====================

**Executive Summary**
---------------------

As students in the Computer Engineering Technology program, we will be
integrating the knowledge and skills we have learned from our program into this
Internet of Things themed capstone project. This proposal requests the approval
to build the hardware portion that will connect to a database as well as to a
mobile device application. The internet connected hardware will include a custom
PCB with sensors and actuators to get information of a device to check if the
device is running smoothly. The database will store this information for all
devices that the user is connected to and will be able to access that
information at will. The mobile device functionality will include being able to
check on the devices that you are connect to, able to give command to the device
to do something depending on what the device can do, able to check for the
latest changes in the device and update the database and will be further
detailed in the mobile application proposal. In the winter semester we are
integrating our project for the second phase of our hardware and also work on
the mobile application. The hardware is completed in CENG 317 Hardware
Production Techniques independently and the application will be completed in
CENG 319 Software Project. These will be integrated together in the subsequent
term in CENG 355 Computer Systems Project in 3 students group.

**Background**
--------------

The Industry 4.0 is a setup that will allow the user to check the temperature,
voltage, and Error reports on a machine that it is connected to the Raspberry Pi
which is the central hub of the factory. The device will use a camera to read in
QR code to read in data. The problem solved by this project is that a user would
be able to scan in data from QR code using the camera operated via the mobile
app. The user would also be able to check temperature, voltage, and error
reports of the machines present in the factory and also remotely operate these
machines to do certain tasks which eliminates the need to be present at the
location.

The industry 4.0 is also known as the fourth industrial revolution. The former
Industry standards are as follows:

\- Industry 1.0 the steam power machines which was introduced in the late 18
Century [@7760744]. An example would be the steam train that used steam to run
the train allowing product to be transported from one location to another faster
than buy transport by horse.

\- Then come the industry 2.0 the power of electricity. With the advancement of
electrical machine in the 20th century product increased [@7760744].

\- The industry 3.0 was the rise of electrical-based machine that can be
modified. “The Programmable Logic Controller (PLC)” is what made the industry
3.0 work by being able to change the programing on the machine with very little
trouble [@7760744].

\- Industry 4.0 is computerized manufacturing which was founded by the German
government. The first uses of the industry 4.0 was at the Hannover Fair in the
2011 [@7760744].

\-The industry 4.0 in today's economy is going to be confronted and triggered by
social, monetary, mechanical and political changes. This will be a subclass of
the current digital age and transform into something much bigger for existing
business and current processes. Number of factors are very critical for Industry
4.0 including things such as lack of skilled workforce, aging society, resource
efficient and clean urban production, increasing product variability, facing
shorter product life cycles in volatile markets and cost reduction pressure. All
these factors need specialized management to cope up with and this is the new
challenge for Industry 4.0 that will hopefully be able to help with [@7748365].

\-Today’s world is getting increasingly more connected both in the virtual as
well as physical space. At the same time customer's ‘needs and wants’ is
evolving. Popularisation of the internet has helped to advance the interactions
between people and systems in an unprecedented manner [@7748364].

\-Machine-to-machine (M2M) communication plays a critical part in the Industry
4.0 revolution and therefore results in the involvement and coordination between
various devices or cyber physical components that are physically placed in
distant/remote geographical locations and across different industries. IoT will
help better interconnect these devices and allow users or companies to easily
operate and keep big data of their machines at all times [@7019732].

In the Computer Engineering Technology program we have learned about the
following topics from the respective relevant courses:

-   Java Docs from CENG 212 Programming Techniques In Java,

-   Construction of circuits from CENG 215 Digital And Interfacing Systems,

-   Rapid application development and Gantt charts from CENG 216 Intro to
    Software Engineering,

-   Micro computing from CENG 252 Embedded Systems,

-   SQL from CENG 254 Database With Java,

-   Web access of databases from CENG 256 Internet Scripting; and,

-   Wireless protocols such as 802.11 from TECH152 Telecom Networks.

This knowledge and skill set will enable me to build the subsystems and
integrate them together as my capstone project.

**Methodology**
---------------

This proposal is assigned in the first week of class and is due at the beginning
of class in the second week of the fall semester. My coursework will focus on
the first two of the 3 phases of this project:  
Phase 1 Hardware build.  
Phase 2 System integration.  
Phase 3 Demonstration to future employers.

*Phase 1 Hardware build*

The hardware build will be completed in the fall term. It will fit within the
CENG Project maximum dimensions of 12 13/16" x 6" x 2 7/8" (32.5cm x 15.25cm x
7.25cm) which represents the space below the tray in the parts kit. The highest
AC voltage that will be used is 16Vrms from a wall adaptor from which +/- 15V or
as high as 45 VDC can be obtained. Maximum power consumption will be 20 Watts.

*Phase 2 System integration*

The system integration will be completed in the fall term.

*Phase 3 Demonstration to future employers*

This project will showcase the knowledge and skills that I have learned to
potential employers.

The tables below provide rough effort and non-labour estimates respectively for
each phase. A Gantt chart will be added by week 3 to provide more project
schedule details and a more complete budget will be added by week 4. It is
important to start tasks as soon as possible to be able to meet deadlines.

**Concluding Remarks**
----------------------

This proposal presents a plan for providing an IoT solution To scan data from QR
code and check temperature, voltage, and error reports of the machines present
in the factory and also remotely operating these machines to do certain tasks
which eliminates the need to be present at the location. This is an opportunity
to integrate the knowledge and skills developed in our program to create a
collaborative IoT capstone project demonstrating my ability to learn how to
support projects such as the initiative described above. I request approval of
this project.

Abstract
========

As the technological age starts to get more advance and increasingly more
apparent in various different industry sectors there is a new revolution waiting
to happen as there was during the industrial revolution. It's called Industrial
Revolution 4.0 and our project will demonstrate and display the fundamentals of
this revolution and how it will impact and help the current industry. In our
case it would be simulating a ‘smart factory’ where the equipment inside, such
as the conveyor belt is constantly being monitored and collecting data that is
being pushed to the cloud where it is accessible by the authorized users which
can be accessed any time. In case of any errors or fault during normal operating
conditions the users will be notified about the fault. The system will consist
of a temperature, voltage and error sensing circuits which in relation will be
connected to the convert belt. Using these sensors, data will be transmitted to
the computer which will sort and setup the data to then be pushed to amazons
cloud service where it will be stored in a database.

The authorized users may then use the android application which connects to the
smart factory and all relevant data will be visible for them. Our project aims
to portray the convenience and efficiency of factory monitoring for companies in
this industry.

Introduction
============

Monitoring the operation of a factory is a tedious job. It requires a lot of
man-hour, to maintain and run safely. Within a factory there are a lot of
machines and devices that do different thing and the need to be running
continually to make as many product as possible, can and at the same time they
require regular checkups to make they are running safety to make sure there are
no delays or dangers. Therefore, our group has come up with a solution that will
allow a user to be able to check temperature, voltage, and error reporting all
the machines and devices within the factory, to make sure everything good and
safe to continue without needing to do regular checkups. In addition, the system
will also allow you to turn on and off machine in the factory by using the
android mobile application.

Our system will store the data into a database on Amazon web, the data well be
stored is temperature, voltage, and errors that may occur with the devices is
obtained with sensors that are connected with the system. The mobile application
will be able to operate and monitor the system. Our system will be using a
camera as an input to read QR code for reading product description. The
information on the database can be accessed straight from the system on a
monitor, and also from the android mobile application.

We as believe that our system will greatly help maintain a factory, while
reducing the amount of man-hour. We will build a simple simulator as proof of
concept that our system works.

### 2.4.1 Database Work Breakdown

The database incorporation for our project is going to be dependent and hosted
on Amazon Web Services (AWS). Using AWS, we are able to connect the raspberry pi
to the cloud which will be monitoring the smart factory. The database created on
Amazons clouds service is a SQL type database and will store relevant
information such as measuring a machines voltage and temperature levels as well
as any error flags the machine might throw in normal operations. There will be a
single table for each factory entered in the database and inside those tables
the columns (or fields) will be listed as: Machine ID, Temperature, Voltage,
Error Messages and Time/Date Stamp. Currently we are using AWS DynamoDB API
which is one of their SQL database service and in our mobile application we have
integrated the API to communicate with the database server. The data stored in
the database such as machine error codes or operating sensors will be accessible
and displayed to authorized users via the mobile app.

### 2.4.2 Android Mobile Application Breakdown

A mobile application is also on development on the Android operating system
devices for our project. The application will monitor and control certain tasks
that are required for the operation of the smart factory. Upon launching the app
the user will be prompted to login into the app. The users will be pre-assigned
username and password which can be used by authorized users to access the app.

The app will control the camera on the Raspberry Pi that will scan QR codes on
packages in the factory which will save the scanned data into the database.
After scanning the data the data can be viewed anytime within the app by
fetching the data from the database which is being created into Amazon’s
WEBServices.

The app will also be used to control the conveyor belt. The app will have
controls that will start and stop the motors of the conveyor belt that will
carry the products with OR code attached to it which will be scanned by the
Raspberry Pi camera which will eventually be saved into the database. This data
is the description of the product.

The app will also display the real time status of the machines and motors in the
factory. The user can view the temperature of the devices, the user can view
voltage drawn by the devices, and the user can also see if any of the devices
send an error report for example: the motor 1 of the conveyor belt breaks down
and needs servicing. The app also has the ability to search all the devices in
the factory, therefore the user can enter the ID of the device to check the
status of it, also if the user is does not familiar with the IDs of the devices
then they can look it up in the list of machines provided in the app and select
the one they want to view.

### 2.4.3 Hardware Application Breakdown

The project Industry 4.0 will be monitoring a smart factory using a raspberry pi
and sensors that will read the voltage, temperature, any error codes and issue
commands to a machine that is inside the smart factory. The main hardware used
in this project are the following:

Raspberry PI 3: This will be a micro-computer that will be connected to a
machine in the factory  
via the onboard sensors, it will also be able to control the machine by either
turning it off or on when there is a problem detected. It will also be connected
to our cloud service (AWS) and using that cloud service we will be storing
relevant data capture by the sensors to the database online where our mobile
application can fetch the data and display it to the users.

PCB Sensor Module: A PCB board made via Eagle Software in class last semester
which has a temperature sensor and voltage reader. The temperature sensor is
used to read the ambient temperature of the machine while the voltage reader
will keep track of the voltage levels on the machine being monitored.

In this semester we plan to have our project incorporate a conveyor belt that
will be used to show and simulate a “Smart Factory” that has moved into the
industrial revolution 4.0 stage and how we are able to connect it the cloud for
easy management and monitoring. The conveyor will be powered by a stepper motor
that will be on connected to the side of the belt via mesh gears. Also the
raspberry pi will be able to control this conveyor belt and speed of motor. This
will be used to simulate the transportation of packages or objects inside the
factory to another location, this process will be easily monitored using the
mobile application for checking the operating status of the machines.

2.5 Build Instructions
----------------------

### 2.5.1 Introduction

The Industrial Revolution 4.0 project build instructions are created for any interested 
individual or group to reproduce our project by throughly following the steps detailed in this section.

The Primary objective of our project is to periodically monitor machine setups in a 'smart factory' where 
all machines withing the factory are connected to the internet and are constantly sending ans receiving 
information to a central hub. These information and operation of the machines are monitored and controlled 
by authorized personnel remotely, therefore a constant presence within the factory is no longer required. 
This technological revolution where smart devices are interconnected over the network that interact with 
each other and operate defines the term Internet of Things (IoT).

![Image of IoT Structure](https://github.com/saadq12/saadq12.github.io/blob/master/images/internet-of-things.jpg)

The main functionality of our project is to keep track and record data of a machine set up in a factory environment. 
To do this we are using a raspberry pi 3, a YL-40 sensor hat and a custom fabricated PCB built in-house at Humber College. 
The data we will be initially looking for from the machine is the current temperature, voltage changes/spikes and also 
error codes that the machine will throw in case of an emergency. All this data that the raspberry pi collects will be 
sent to the cloud using AWS (amazon web services). Users will then be able to keep track of all this data and easily 
access it through our android smart phone app which scans a QR code attached to the machines and connects to a database 
stored on amazon cloud service.

Description:

This system diagram gives an idea of how our hardware project works:

1. Inside the factory are machines connected to a raspberry pi and it will be monitoring each associated machine.

2. While the Pi is fetching data from the machines it will also be simultaneously uploading that data onto our amazon cloud.

3. All data will be stored on the cloud using amazon web service.

4. Our smart phone app will integrate into the amazon cloud allowing users to fetch data in real-time about the machines.

**Step 2 - Creating Case and motor wheel**

Use the website call makercase to generate a template case with your preferred
dimensions. After that you will need to download and install CoralDarw so that
you can and in the customise the case by make cut out so that wire and come in
and so that can connect other hole the all you to screw things onto the case.

The case is made out of 3 mm acrylic and is used to hold all the part in and is
also the frame for the conveyor belt. There are holes between the top and center
of the case on both side used the hold the conveyor belt in place. The last hole
for the belt is a rectangle to semi-circle on the end, this hole is use to
stretch out belt. Depending on how long the conveyor belt is depends on how many
hole you will need to make of the case. There are also hole made to hold the
camera, stepper motor, and sensor onto the case with holes underneath them to
put the wire inside the case.

The motor wheel is use to connect the PVC pipe to the stepper motor to run the
conveyor belt. It is made of two circles that are glue together and have whole
to allow it to connect to that motor and pex pipe. You will need to use 6 mm
acrylic for the wheel.

The file for both lasers cut will be available on the following website:
https://github.com/saadq12/saadq12.github.io

**Step 3 - Create conveyor belt**

\- The wooden dowel are use to hold the pex pipe in place inside the case. You
will need cut the wooden dowels into smaller pieces, depending how many hole on
the case that will be used to hold the belt in place depend the number of dowel
you need to make. The first dowel will be 1 inch smaller then the width of the
case and all the other ones will be 1 1/2 inch long then the case. After cut the
all dowels sand the edges then take the two of long dowel and sand of a small
amount on both ends of each of the dowels until the ends can fit in the eyes of
the turnbuckle. This dowel will be use as axial to hold the pex pipe in place
within the case to hold the belt.

The pex pipe will be used as roller that will allow the conveyor belt to move
freely. You will need to cut the 5 feet in small pipe that will fit into your
case. The pipes you need have to equal to the number of dowel you have first one
will be 1 inch smaller the width of the case and all the other ones will be 1/2
inch smaller then the width of the case. Take the small pipe and cut out small
rectangles at the one of the end so that the motor bit will fit in and lock in
place.

To make the belt make you measurement first, find out how long you need you belt
to be by measuring the length from the first roller to the last roller end to
end and then double it and the width is the same as the shortest pipe you cut
out early. After getting you measurement roll out the grip liner and cut it and
sew it together short end to short end.

Know that all the part are made for the conveyor belt we can but it together and
see if it works.

\- First take the stepper motor mount it to the case on the side where there is
a hole with two smaller holes below it. The two smaller hole are were screw will
place hold the motor in place.

\- After that take the motor wheel and connect it to the short pipe with the
side that has cut at the end it should fit in and lock in place. Once that is
done you will take the belt put the pipe inside the belt and connect it to the
motor with the wheel and the opposite side there is a whole the short wooden
dowel to hold the other side.

\- Do the same thing for all the remaining dowel and pipe. Put the pipe into the
belt then lock in place with by connect the pipe and case together with the
dowel form one side of the case to the there.

\- After that is done you will connect the turnbuckles to both side of the last
dowel and the second dowel this will be used to stretch out the belt.

\- Once all that is done turn on the motor and test the belt out to see it move.

Conclusions
===========

The Industry 4.0 project was mainly focused on simulating a 'smart factory' environment where all the machines and processes 
are completely automated. The main idea of this project was to demonstrate the fundamentals of the coming generation 
of the industrial operation i.e. it almost eliminates the human presence in the factory during operation. Maintaining the 
operations consumes a lot of time and requires safety precautions that are needed to followed for smooth operation. However, with our 
project which was less than $300(CAD) we were able to demonstrate that we can reduce and almost eliminate the need of regular 
monitoring of the devices and processes of a smart factory.

Our system is able to monitor and operate the devices present in the factory. The system is able to monitor the voltage, temperature,
and error logs of the devices from various sensors connected to our system, then these data are sent to a database hosted
on Amazons WebServices. These data can be checked on the mobile application that has been developed specifically for our project. 
The system also has a camera attached to it that records the data of a product by scanning QR code attached to it. The product moves
along the conveyor belt and a motion sensor detects it and triggers the camera to capture the QR code. This data is then
translated by the Raspberry Pi and sends it to the database. Finally, this data can be viewed in the app anytime.

With our project we were able to demonstrate that the constant human presence inside a factory to monitor and operate devices
is not mandatory. These work can be automated and be monitored remotely at any time.

The ultimate goal of Industry 4.0 project is to push the current generation of industry standards to the next one so that
we are able to conserve more resources and make it more efficient.



Recommendation
==============

For better enhancements of this project we as a group have noted a few hardware improvements that could have been done to make our 
project appear and function a bit more efficiently. 

Certain modifications could have been done like the parts that were able to be replaced for better performance. 
These include the parts that were used to make the conveyor belt such the motor, the roller, and the motion sensor.

The motor that we use was a 5V DC stepper motor that as connect to the raspberry pi 3. The problem that we had with this type 
of motor is that the amount of torque it gives you is really small making the belt move slowly and when you tighten the belt 
the belt will not move. By using a more powerful motor the belt will be able to move faster and when you tighten it up will 
still be able to run.

The rollers that we used are made out of pex pipe and wooden dowels which hold the rollers up on the axis and then are wrapped 
with the conveyor belt. A better solution to this would be to use a different product like a PVC pipe because they are stronger 
and would not bend that easily when there is a significant load on the belt.

The motion sensor that we are using to detect the box was found to be way to sensitive and would trigger it self with the slightest 
of movement, to fix this issue we had to make a acrylic border around the sensor to make it focus just on that one specified area. 
An easy solution is the use a sensor that has smaller and more precise detecting range such as a Laser IR sensor which 
would have a transmitter and receiver on both ends of the conveyor belt.

The cost could also be reduced to a certain amount, for example only a Raspberry Pi could be used instead of getting a whole kit 
worth $99.99(CAD), a raspberry pi 3 would only cost $55.99.
