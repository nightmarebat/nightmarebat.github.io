School:Humber College<br>
Project Duration: September 2016 - April 2017 <br></H4><br>
<H3>Project:<br>
		Industrial Revolution 4.0: Building IoT Projects
</H3><br>

	 <H5>	Project Summary:<br>
		Industry 4.0, Industrie 4.0 or the fourth industrial revolution, is the current trend of automation and data exchange in 
		manufacturing technologies. It includes cyber-physical systems, the Internet of things and cloud computing.
		Industry 4.0 creates what has been called a "smart factory". Within the modular structured smart factories, 
		cyber-physical systems monitor physical processes, create a virtual copy of the physical world and make decentralized decisions. 
		Over the Internet of Things, cyber-physical systems communicate and cooperate with each other and with humans in real time, 
		and via the Internet of Services, both internal and cross-organizational services are offered and used by participants of the 
		value chain.<br>

  <p>Progress Report:
   <ul>
    <li>Mechanical assembly of hardware components are being done. 
	    The hardware components have been acquired also the PCB has been soldered and tested.
	    The are still many things we need to do like making the case for the camera, 
	    connecting the camera and PCB to the Raspberry pi.
	    </li>
	<li>The current problem that is arising is on how to link the hardware to the cloud services. 
		We are still working on it to figure it out</li>
	
	   <li> Another problem was buying the camera because when 
		   I first bought the camera i bought the wrong on so i had to cancel it and by the right camera. 
	   
	   
	   <li> The cost of the part was more than estimated. 
		   It was $151.30 for the Rasberry pi,
		   $64.47 for the camera 
		   and the PCB was given to us be the school so we didn't have to pay for it.</li>
	   <li>the total cost in the end was $215.77.
		   
	   <li> some web that will help me are:</li>
