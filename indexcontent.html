<H3>Project:<br>
		Industrial Revolution 4.0: Building IoT Projects
</H3><br>

	 <H5>	Project Summary:<br>
		Industry 4.0, Industrie 4.0 or the fourth industrial revolution, is the current trend of automation and data exchange in 
		manufacturing technologies. It includes cyber-physical systems, the Internet of things and cloud computing.
		Industry 4.0 creates what has been called a "smart factory". Within the modular structured smart factories, 
		cyber-physical systems monitor physical processes, create a virtual copy of the physical world and make decentralized decisions. 
		Over the Internet of Things, cyber-physical systems communicate and cooperate with each other and with humans in real time, 
		and via the Internet of Services, both internal and cross-organizational services are offered and used by participants of the 
		value chain.<br>

  <p>Progress Report:
   <ul>
    <li>Mechanical assembly of hardware components are being done. 
	    The hardware componets have been aquired also the PCB has been soldered and tested.
	    The are still many things we need to do like making the case for the camera, 
	    connecting the camera, PCB to the the Raspberry pi.
	    </li>
	<li>The current problem that is arising is on how to link the hardware to the cloud services. 
		We are still working on it to figure it out</li>

   <p><ul>
    <li>Solder together a sensor hat (parts provided from J206) for a Raspberry Pi 3 (that you purchase). This Broadcom development platform was chosen for a number of reasons. Let us start with platform requirements, it should be able to be used to create a small programmable device capable of connecting to enterprise Wi-Fi, bluetooth, and I2C. The NXP HCS12 can have a network stack loaded on it, but then not be able to do much more and thus the device would require multiple HCS12s for this purpose causing an increase in cost. Likewise with Atmel based Arduinos, connecting them to enterprise Wi-Fi is not straighforward. TI's beaglebone shows promise as an alternative however you would need to redesign the sensor hat in order to be compatible.</li>
	<li>Kits of sensor hat parts should be available in J206 (hours posted outside the door) to get started before the term starts if you like.</li>
	<li>Here are some videos on soldering: <a

	<li>I have my Pi 3 in this case <a href="http://www.canakit.com/raspberry-pi-black-case.html">http://www.canakit.com/raspberry-pi-black-case.html</a> and we bought USB network adaptors from Tiger Direct. Note that USB webcams are more economical and robust than pi specific ones. Paul Moggach's Raspberry Pi Technical Notes which give some idea of how to use the network adaptor and more extensive programming examples, than the simple program that should blink the (red-green) LED that I emailed, are available via login at: <a

	<li>There is also a guide to buying a Raspberry Pi as part of <a href="https://www.lynda.com/Raspberry-Pi-tutorials/Up-Running-Raspberry-Pi/191267-2.html">https://www.lynda.com/Raspberry-Pi-tutorials/Up-Running-Raspberry-Pi/191267-2.html</a></li>
